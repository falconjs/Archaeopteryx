    "<p>This lecture is devoted to the topic of study design.  One of the most important factors in both reading and evaluating published literature and in designing your own research is a thorough understanding of the variety in study types.  Indeed, the choice of study type has a direct bearing on the findings, its importance and relevance.</p>\n",
    "<p>As with most scientific endeavors, the classification of study type is varied and different schemes exist to classify designs.  One logical approach is to divide designs into two main groups: *observational* and *experimental*.  In observational studies, subjects or variables are merely observed and in experimental studies, an intervention is performed.  From this basic difference a scheme to different study design can follow.</p>\n",

In the case where experimental studies involve humans as test subjects, the term *clinical trial* is more commonly used.  Experimental trials are further divided depending on the type of control that is used for comparison: *trials with independent concurrent controls*, *trials with self-controls* (dependent groups), *trials with external controls*, and *uncontrolled trials*.</p>"

    "<p>No research hypothesis exists and these studies are usually used to identify interesting observations for more detailed research or future planning.</p>\n",
    "<p>Note that the actual data collection (for this and other types) can be performed either in *retrospect*, where we take the files and hunt for values for chosen variables, or in *prospect*, where we decide beforehand what variables we want documented and collect these during the management of every patient.</p>"

    "<p>A case-control study starts with the presence (or absence) of an outcome and looks rearwards in time comparing subjects with and without the particular outcome in an attempt to find risk factors or characteristics that differ between the groups.  It is important to note that the two groups are identified at the start of the study and data points on various variables are then collected retrospectively.</p>\n",
    "<p>Do not confuse this with the terms prospective and retrospective.  Let me explain.  Nothing prevents you from setting up a database for any particular group or disease or whatever in your department or unit.  You may have no plans yet for any research.  What you are looking for is a set of variables, which you want completed for every patient.  This type of data collection is done prospectively.  On the other hand, you might have not had this forethought and simply go to the free-form notes in the patient files.  This data collection is done retrospectively.</p>\n",
    "<p>Back to case-control serieds.  A good example would be to look at a group of patients who has had a particular procedure, with two varying outcomes.  The fact that both groups had the same intervention differentiates this from an experimental study.  Individuals with one outcome are separated from those with another outcome and data is collected on decided variables.  The measurements are compared, to look for any differences.</p>\n",
    "<p>The main disadvantage of this type of study is a concept termed confounding.  It refers to a fact that a specific causative agent or parameter is difficult to identify.  A good illustrative example would be that of the intake of meat in patients who suffer a myocardial infarction.  It might be found that these patients have a high level of meat intake, but this is no proof that the meat was the causative agent.  Meat-eaters might also have a high incidence of smoking, drinking, poor exercise regimes, and many others.</p>\n",
    "<p>In a *nested case-control study*, cases and controls are taken from a prospective cohort study.  The cases develop a certain effect and the controls donâ€™t.</p>"

The outstanding identifying factor in the heterogenous groups is that an observation was made at a particular point in time, as opposed to over a period of time.  To complicate matters ever so slightly, this type of study can be incorporated in other designs.  It can, for example, be used as part of case-control or cohort studies.</p>\n",
    "<p>A common use for cross-sectional studies is investigating correlation, whether between cause and effect or accuracy of diagnostic techniques, to name but two examples.  As with case-control studies, cross-sectional studies also suffer from confounding and when cause and effect are under investigation, it is often impossible to prove that the cause actually is that and indeed came before the effect.</p>"

Subjects with the specific characteristic is identified at the start of the study and followed with measurement of various variables in a prospective manner.  The time period does not necessarily have to be that long.  Some prospective follow-ups after an intervention can last for a few days, for instance after a surgical procedure, termed outcome assessment.</p>\n",

This is usually impossible with common differences in age, gender, body habitus, and many others present.  Subgroups can then usually be formed so as to keep the differences to a non-clinically significant level.</p>\n",
