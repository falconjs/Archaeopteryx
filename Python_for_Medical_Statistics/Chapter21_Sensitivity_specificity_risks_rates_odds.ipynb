    "<p>Odds is indeed a very peculiar term and must always be interpreted with caution and in view of how common or rare an event is.  Whereas rates and risk result in the probability of likelihood of occurrence (change), the odds are just that, the odds of an occurrence.</p>\n",
    "<p>It is useful for two reasons.  Firstly, when dealing with case-control studies, it is the only valid measure of relative risk.  Remember that in a case-control study the number of cases and controls are chosen beforehand.  This choice commands an absolute effect on rates and risks and is set by the study design.  Secondly, it is usually calculated by logistic regression (and then expressed as adjusted odds ratio as opposed to unadjusted odds ratio).  Using logistic regression can compensate for confounding.</p>\n",
    "<p>Odds are the ratio of the probability of an event divided by the probability of the event not occurring.  If the probability fo an event occuring is a half (0.5), then the probability of it not occuring is 0.5.  This gives you odds of 1.  Let's do another example.  If the probability of an event occuring is 0.75, then the probability of it not occuring is 0.25 (1.0 - 0.75), giving odds of 3 to 1 or 3.</p>\n",
    "<p>For rare events, arbitrarily chosen as equal to or less than 10%, risks and odds are close in value, but when events are more common, the odds are much higher than the risk.</p>"

    "<p>The concept of odds is best explained by an example.  Consider two parameters.  The first has three values (it is categorical): low, moderate, and high, and the second is expressed as the prevalence of that parameter with respect to patients in the specific group of parameter 1.</p>\n",
    "<p>Let's say that for the low group the prevalence of parameter 2 is 0.9%, for the moderate group it is 2.3% and for the high group it is 3.0%.</p>\n",
    "<p>the risk ratio in the low group is reference (0.9% / 0.9%) = *1.0*.  For the moderate group it is (2.3% / 0.9%) 2.56 and for the high group it is 3.33.</p>\n",
    "<p>Now, let's do the odds ratio.  remember it is the ratio of the probability of something occuring and it not occuring.  So for the low group it will be 0.9% divided by 99.1% (note I am expressing values in percent here), which is 0.0091.  This is our reference.  The odds of parameter 2 in the moderate group is 2.3% and therefore 97.7% against.  The odds ratio for parameter 2 in this groups is then 2.3% / 97.7%, which is 0.0235.  Dividing this by our reference 0.0091 gives an odds ratio of 2.58.  For the high group we have odds for parameter 2 of 3%, thus odds (probability) against of 97%, with an odds ratio of (3 % / 97%) 0.031.  This divided by our refernce (0.0091) gives an odds ratio of 3.41.</p>"
